### 🌿 Tree Identification
- Advanced DenseNet model for accurate species identification
- Support for multiple tree species
- Confidence scoring for predictions
- Real-time processing capabilities

### 📏 Dimension Analysis
- Precise height and width measurements
- Reference-based scaling for accurate results
- Support for various measurement units
- Automated dimension calculation

### 📍 Location Tracking
- GPS coordinate extraction from images
- Interactive map visualization
- Tree clustering for better visualization
- Location-based analysis

### 🖥️ Modern Web Interface
- Clean, responsive dashboard
- Interactive data tables
- Real-time map view
- Excel export functionality
- Image preview capabilities

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Flask
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekiit2014032/tree_project.git
cd tree_project
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the model:
```bash
python download_model.py
```

### Usage

1. Place your tree images in the `tree_images` directory

2. Run the analysis:
```bash
python driver_script.py
```

3. Access the web dashboard:
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
- View the table of analyzed trees
- Click "Map View" to see trees plotted on an interactive map
- Click on tree markers to view detailed information
- Use the export button to download analysis results
